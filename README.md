# Monkey Lang

Learning how programming languages work by building one.

This repo contains my source code as I go through Thorsten Ball's 2 books around writing an interpreter and compiler using go.

## Resources
- https://interpreterbook.com/
- https://compilerbook.com/

## Usage

- `go build`
- `./monkey` to start the REPL
- `./monkey example.monkey` to evaluate a file
- `go test ./...` to run the test suite
